# Showcase Video Of Point Cloud Visualizer
{{< youtube rrfGdJUEJxk >}}

### [Note : This was a group project of 5. The techniques noted below are my personal contributions towards the project]
## Features
* Implemented Morphological transforms such as Hit or Miss transform, Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing,
Template Matching.
* Added several edge detection algorithms such as Sorbel edge detectors, Laplacian edge detectors, and Unsharp
masking.
* Disparity/Depth map generation by extracting relevant camera calibration data.
* Implemented segmentation algorithms such as WaterShed segmentation and Colour space segmentation (HSV).
* For pre-processing of images, implemented frequency domain filters such as Butterworthâ€™s low/high pass filter,
Ideal low/high pass filter
* Created a C++/DirectX11 application to represent the depth map in form of a point cloud visualizer.
