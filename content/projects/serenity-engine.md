## Features
* Used the game engine to create a simple obstacle - avoidance game that uses C++, HLSL and DirectX12 for rendering. 
* Implemented realtime analytical atmosphere model (Preetham-Sky) using compute shaders. 
* Uses Lua scripting for initializing the game scene and for obstacle behaviour. 
* Implemented game UI system, scene and script editor using ImGUI.
